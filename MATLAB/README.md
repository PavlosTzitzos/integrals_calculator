Integrals Version in MATLAB:
----------------------------
This is the first version of the intagrals calculator.

Every integral is in different folder.


Folder:

* Double : double integrals in cartesian , polar and elliptical coordinates 

* Triple : triple integrals in cartesian , spherical , cylindrical and ellipsoidal coordinates

* Line : line integrals for scalar and vector functions with alternative: double integral

* Surface : surface integrals for scalar and vector functions with change of variables

* General : not yet ready

Files:

* Integral.m : examples of double integrals

* IOV.m : examples to compute volumes from function rotation

* AllIntegrals.m , Integrals.m , Integrals2.m : first effort to make one total application in matlab. It is not continued cause you can use the pysimplegui version
